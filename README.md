### Hi there

I'm Srinath. I'm a Master's Student, studying Computer Science at Arizona State University, in Tempe.

#### My Experience 

- I was a Machine Learning Intern at AstraZeneca, where I worked on projects in Cheminformatics and Bioinformatics.
- I was also a Computer Vision Research Intern at IIITDM Kancheepuram, where I co-wrote 2 papers on Face Detection and Recognition in low-illumination environments. 
- I also spearheaded the development of a Full Stack Web application for my Undergrad College's Model United Nations.

#### My interests 

- My research interests lie in the intersection of Computer Vision and Robotics. I hope to work on a thesis in the same field during my Master's program.
- In the future, I want to work on Lunar and/or Martian Vehicles that use Computer Vision and SLAM algorithms.

#### Fun fact: 

I can solve the Rubik's cube [kinda fast.](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2015SRIN10) :D
