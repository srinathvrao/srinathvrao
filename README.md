### Hi there

I'm Srinath. I'm a Master's Student, studying Computer Science at Arizona State University, in Tempe. I am looking for an internship during the Summer of 2022.

#### My Experience 

- I was a Machine Learning Intern at AstraZeneca, where I worked on projects in Cheminformatics and Bioinformatics.
- I was also a Computer Vision Research Intern at IIITDM Kancheepuram. I co-wrote a paper that I presented at IEEE CICT, 2020. 
- I also spearheaded the development of a Full Stack Web application for my Undergrad College's Model United Nations.

#### Iâ€™m looking to work on 

- My research interests lie in the intersection of Computer Vision and Robotics. I hope to work on a thesis in the same field during my Master's program.
- Lunar and/or Martian Vehicles that use Computer Vision and SLAM algorithms sometime in the future.

#### Fun fact: 

I can solve the Rubik's cube [kinda fast.](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2015SRIN10) :D
