### Hi there

I'm Srinath. I like working on projects in Machine Learning and Computer Vision.

#### ðŸŒ± My Experience 

- I was a Machine Learning Intern at AstraZeneca, where I worked on projects in Cheminformatics and Bioinformatics.
- I was also a Computer Vision Research Intern at IIITDM Kancheepuram. I co-wrote a paper that I presented at IEEE CICT, 2020. 
- I also spearheaded the development of a Full Stack Web application for my College's Model United Nations.

#### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to work on 

Lunar and/or Martian Vehicles that use Computer Vision and SLAM algorithms sometime in the future, why not?

#### âš¡ Fun fact: 

I can solve the Rubik's cube [kinda fast.](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2015SRIN10) :D
