### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Srinath. I like playing video games, and building software.

#### ðŸŒ± My Experience 

- I was a Computer Vision Research Intern at IIITDM Kancheepuram. I co-wrote a paper that I presented at IEEE CICT, 2020. 
- I was also a Data Science Intern at AstraZeneca, where I worked on projects in Cheminformatics and Bioinformatics.

#### ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 

- VLocNet (A vision-based navigation algorithm)
- A Kaggle competition I've got my eyes on :eyes:	

#### ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to work on 

Lunar and/or Martian Vehicles that use Computer Vision and SLAM algorithms sometime in the future, why not?

#### âš¡ Fun fact: 

I can solve the Rubik's cube [kinda fast.](https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2015SRIN10) :D
